# GoFinalProject

Hello! 
This project allows the user to self host an api and search for any game on the provided Excel sheet and recieve information of that game in JSON format.

Run the program and now you are ready! Go to localhost:8090/search/... replacing ... with any game name from the Excel sheet. The program
will then provide info in JSON format.

Key Notes: 
When searching for a game be sure to use the proper Query name in the Excel Sheet. For example, localhost:8090/search/Counter-Strike will bring up the desired game
Counter-Strike but Counter Strike will "strike" an error. So please use caution when spelling and punctuating. Besides this the program self-hosts and 
allows the user to search the 13,283 different listings from the Excel sheet and their desired data.
